👋 Greetings, Earthlings! I’m @tiirth22, currently navigating the thrilling world of academia as a sophomore at CHARUSAT University. When I’m not buried in textbooks, 
    you can find me conjuring up digital sorcery with app development and dabbling in the arcane arts of Machine Learning.

👀 My interests? Oh, they’re as vast as the universe! From breathing life into apps to unraveling the mysteries of artificial intelligence, I’m on a quest to absorb knowledge like a supercharged black hole.

🌱 My current academic spells? I’m weaving my magic with C#, C++, Python 🐍 structuring my thoughts with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and occasionally stirring the cauldron with a pinch of Machine Learning.

⚡ Fun fact: Despite what you might think, I'm not just any college student—I'm a BOT in disguise! Shh... don't blow my cover! 🤖✨
